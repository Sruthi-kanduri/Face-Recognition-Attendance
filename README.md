Facial recognition technology is revolutionizing attendance management in various sectors. The changes it introduces in attendance taking-an automatic process within the classroom, the office, or a large gathering-set standards regarding accuracy, efficiency, and security. This paper details the design and implementation of an attendance system, based on facial recognition, using Python and OpenCV. The methodology involves using machine learning for the identification of individuals from their facial features and then automatic real-time attendance logging. It includes the modules involved, data processing pipeline, algorithms for detection and recognition of face, interactions via a graphical user interface by a person, data storage, and generated results during the execution of the system. There are also practical benefits, limitations for this method as well, which explains about data storage and result obtained during the working of system.
